_**Note:** This project is presently dead and I have no immediate plans to finish it. This is in part due to other priorities, and in part because of the instability of the NWS APIs. Once the APIs are more stable, I may continue work here or re-implement in another language (Python?)._

Interact with the United States [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov) API from the EPA in Go.
