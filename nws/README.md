# OurWx (`ourwx`)

Interact with United States National Weather Service (NWS) APIs in Go.

## Warning!

This project is a work in progress and absolutely not production ready. The exported interface is unstable. 

## Introduction

Although several companies provide web APIs for weather data, most of them are limited or unavailable without a fee. The NWS uses our tax dollars to collect and analyze a full range of weather data. It is our (the public's) data and is available at [weather.gov](http://www.weather.gov). The goal of this library is to provide a convenient way to access that data in Go. 

OurWx is still in the very early stages of development, but as I continue to work on this project, I hope to increase the both the number of APIs available and amount of data retreived from each.
