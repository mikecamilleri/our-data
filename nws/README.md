# our-data-go/nws

Interact with the United States National Weather Service (NWS) API in Go.

This was recently moved so _everything is broken_!

## Warning!

This project is a work in progress and absolutely not production ready. The exported interface is unstable. 

## Introduction

Although several companies provide web APIs for weather data, most of them are limited or unavailable without a fee. The NWS analyze a full range of weather data and is available for free at [weather.gov](http://www.weather.gov) and via several APIs. The goal of this package is to provide a convenient way to access those data in Go. The API used in this package is documented [here](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api).
